# User Folder
This folder contains notebooks that can be run in order to generate optimized CCZ pulses in the case of infinite blockade and zero next-nearest-neighbor
interactions or the case of finite blockade and nonzero next-nearest-neighbor interactions. There are also notebooks for analyzing the robustness of theses pulses to noise 
and state population probabilities throughout the duration of the pulse
